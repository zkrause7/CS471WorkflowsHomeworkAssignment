- [ ] :hourglass_flowing_sand: Wait (at most) 60 seconds until the [WorkflowLearning GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/workflowlearning) will comment on this task and confirm that the branch `task_2_merge` was created (refresh the page if you don't see the confirmation comment)
- [ ] [Create a new PR](../compare/task_2_merge?expand=1) having the **base** branch `master` and the **compare** branch `task_2_merge`
- [ ] Edit the description of the PR to reference this task (i.e., the PR description should contain `Closes #2`)
